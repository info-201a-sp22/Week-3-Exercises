# Exercise 6-1



# Exercise 1: calling built-in functions

# Create a variable `my_name` that contains your name


# Create a variable `name_length` that holds how many letters (including spaces)
# are in your name (use the `nchar()` function)


# Print the number of letters in your name


# Create a variable `now_doing` that is your name followed by "is programming!"
# (use the `paste()` function)


# Make the `now_doing` variable upper case


### Bonus

# Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to
# variables `fav_1` and `fav_2`


# Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save the new value in the
# original variable


# Create a variable `raw_sum` that is the sum of the two variables. Use the
# `sum()` function for practice.


# Create a variable `round_sum` that is the `raw_sum` rounded to 1 decimal place.
# Use the `round()` function.


# Create two new variables `round_1` and `round_2` that are your `fav_1` and
# `fav_2` variables rounded to 1 decimal places


# Create a variable `sum_round` that is the sum of the rounded values


# Which is bigger, `round_sum` or `sum_round`? (You can use the `max()` function!)
